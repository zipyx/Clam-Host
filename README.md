# Clam-Host
Centralized ASP Core project hosting site displaying multiple projects created and managed by me, and if possible to display the content of the project live within view.

### Please Note
- The entire project cannot be uploaded as there are two many files to uploaded, so a small partial of the project is uploaded here which is the hub and container.
- This projest is made up of other projects added to create a centralized view. So what you may be seeing in this repository is a sub component of this project.
- MVC & Repository Pattern is at the core of this project, as I wanted all components to be unit tested as much as possible and to which it is still in progress.
